# Observer

Observer is a system for studying JavaScript click interception practices. It tracks the creation of HTML anchor and script elements, records accesses to HTML anchor elements, and monitors JavaScript event listeners.

Observer is implemented on Chromium (version 64.0.3282.186).

You can find more information about Observer in our [USENIX Security 2019 research paper](https://seclab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/papers/sec19_click_interception.pdf). Please consider citing our paper when using Observer. The BibTeX format file is provided with the source code.

## Setup and Build
The following build script works only on Debian, Ubuntu and macOS.

```shell
# Install depot_tools
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools

# Fetch source and build
./build_observer.sh --all
```

The above command will fetch the source code of Chromium version 64.0.3282.186, apply our patch to it, and build Observer.

For more information about the options, use:

```shell
./build_observer.sh --help
```

When building on macOS, you might need to install an older version of MacOS SDK included by Xcode. The SDKs are available [here](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs).

You can also use distributed build tools like [icecc](https://github.com/icecc/icecream) to speedup the build.

## Run on Linux

```shell
cd src
ENABLE_OBSERVER=1 out/Observer/chrome --no-sandbox
```

## Run on macOS

```shell
cd src
ENABLE_OBSERVER=1 out/Observer/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --no-sandbox
```

## Data Collection

For performance concerns, Observer adopts a lazy update mechanism for setting some custom attributes (e.g., initiator, observerLog, etc.). The values of these attributes are updated in the DOM tree only when the attributes are first accessed by JavaScript.
Following are the description about the attributes that are set and collected by Observer.

* The *observerLog* attribute includes logs of read & write operations by JavaScript.
* The *initiator* attribute represents the scriptID of the initiating script of an element.
* The *nid* attribute is a unique ID of a DOM node.
* The *displayInfo* attribute collects display related style properties of an element for detecting elements used in visual deception.
* The *scriptID* and *parentScriptID* attributes are the IDs of a script and its parent script.
* The *scriptIDMap* includes a map from the scriptID of a script to its URL in the document, and a map from the scriptID of a script to that of its parent script.
* The *apiLog* includes logs related to navigation events (e.g., nid, the navigation API name, the navigation URL, etc.) of an element.

We provide the following scripts to access the custom attributes. They can be injected to Chromium using Selenium after a page is completed loaded.

* *js/fetchDocLog.js*: traverse the DOM tree, access observerLog and initiator, etc., set displayInfo attribute of every HTML element and get the scriptID map.
* *js/fireEvents.js*: traverse the DOM tree, click all the clickable HTML element and retrieve the apiLog.
